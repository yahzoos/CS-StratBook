# TODO

## pkg Tags

### Current Behavior

- each individual json is dumped into working directory
- only a single nade is "tagged" when multi nade annotations exist

### Changes
- Find a place to dump the json files. New folder? In each annoation folder?
- Maybe configure multi nade annotations to split out?

## pkg MetaData Exporer

- reload tags.json whenever the tab is clicked (or have a button)
- Crashes when clicking on the right side grid if nothing is there. (before pressing the apply filters button)
- Create "all maps" dropdown
-- or auto load (basically click the button for first map in list)


## main.gui.go

- Change app name in the title bar.

# Features

- Add nades from metadata explorer to the File generator (new tab? New window?) add button, and right click ment. remove button. Display selected where? Bottom left?

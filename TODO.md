## pkg Tags

### Current Behavior

- each individual json is dumped into working directory
- only a single nade is "tagged" when multi nade annotations exist

### Changes
- Find a place to dump the json files. New folder? In each annoation folder?
- Maybe configure multi nade annotations to split out?
